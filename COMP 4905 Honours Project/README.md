# COMP 4905 Honours Project

The following Honours project report details the successful development of Playback Sensation, 
a web-based application that provides an efficient solution for musicians frequently struggling to track their progress on a music score while playing along with a music recording. 
Developed as a Node.js web application that utilizes numerous frameworks and middleware, the Honours project takes in a PDF music score and MP3 recording submitted by the user, 
records which music bars to highlight at what timestamp in the MP3 recording, and displays the results of the user's inputs in the PDF viewer. 
By incorporating JavaScript scripts, HTML pages, and CSS stylesheets, the application successfully implemented all the features stated in the Honours project proposal. 
Although some challenges impeded the development schedule of the Honours project, particularly the initial misunderstanding of the project requirements due to miscommunication issues, I accomplished all the project objectives I initially envisioned and produced a reliable tool for musically experienced users.
